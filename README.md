# MiniCompiler
-The purpose of this project is to develop in C a function called "geracod", which implements a small code generator (a "micro-compiler") for a very simple programming language called SB.  

# How the SB language works
- The local variables follow the form vi, i identifies the variable (i.e v1,v2,...).   
- There is a max of 4 variables.  
- The parameters works similar, following the form pi.  
- Constants are written follow $i (i.e $1,$-1)  
- The file **_testTrab.txt_** illustrates the language.  

# Development enviroment
- Operational System: Fedora 23  
- Language: C  
- Compiler: gcc  

# How to compile and execute
